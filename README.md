This repository contains the implementation of *Projected Coupled Diffusion* (PCD). 


## 📢 Introduction
We propose *Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD)*, a novel test-time framework for constrained joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints. 
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
